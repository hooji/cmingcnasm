x86/x86_64 important notes:
there is an infrastructure in the linux kernel to select proper code path based
on cpuinfo flags. Namely, for cross compilation, we would need to inject more
than just the architecture in order to select the right code path.
Selecting the right code path at runtime is an issue which concern *only*
binary distributed programs (most of them are close source), then not us:
Because, it's lame.
