*Do* really check the pattern dir. Those are supposed to be building blocks
for your applications.

NAMESPACES:
  - k_ generic namespace for ulinux
  - u_ generic namespace for utils
      * u_a utils for ascii namespace

Why no magic include files: then you have the information of "what's in".
This is not dirty RAD and it will take time to reach enough stability to justify shared objects.
Why override the compiler types: because they are long, and name the short ones the same way.

Compiler types (scalability) with some semantics:
 - size semantics:
     * no range constraint:unsigned long... do not mistake it with linux k_sz
     * range constraint:take the smallest compiler (C standard) unsigned integer type garanteed to fit the range
 - bool semantics:unsigned tiny (mapped to minimum 8 bits compiler type... unsigned char).
may do some typedef, one day.


CUSTOMARY ABBREVIATIONS:
blk  block
buf  buffer
